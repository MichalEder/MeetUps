# Django demo project - MeetUps

A Django app for organizing meetups and allowing users to register with their email. Stores informations in SQLite database. 

This is a demo project where I tried do things better, than in my first Django project LibrApp, which was my first bigger project and needs a lot of refactoring.

## Features

* **Admin Interface:** Admins can create new meetups with the following details:
  * Title
  * Date
  * Description
  * Image
  * Location
* **Meetup Listings:** Users can view a list of upcoming meetups.
* **Meetup Details:** Users can see detailed information about individual meetups.
* **Registration:** Users can register for meetups by providing their email address.
* **Registration Confirmation:** Users receive a confirmation message after registering.
